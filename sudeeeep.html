<p>Cardiac arrest, also known as sudden cardiac arrest, is when the heart suddenly and unexpectedly stops beating. As a result, blood cannot properly circulate around the body and there is diminished blood flow to the brain and other organs. When the brain does not receive enough blood, this can cause a person to lose consciousness. Coma and persistent vegetative state may result from cardiac arrest. Cardiac arrest is also identified by a lack of central pulses and abnormal or absent breathing.</p>
<p>Cardiac arrest is diagnosed by the inability to find a pulse in an unresponsive patient.The goal of treatment for cardiac arrest is to rapidly achieve return of spontaneous circulation using a variety of interventions including CPR, defibrillation, and/or cardiac pacing. Two protocols have been established for CPR: basic life support (BLS) and advanced cardiac life support (ACLS).</p>
<p>Cardiac arrest becomes more common with age and affects males more often than females. Black people are twice as likely to die from cardiac arrest as white people. Asian and Hispanic people are not as frequently affected as white people.</p>
